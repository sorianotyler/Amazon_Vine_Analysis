# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of Project
 The objective of this project is to practice extracting, transformaing and load large data sets to a database. We are successfully uploading data from Amazon to an AWS db instance. 
### Purpose
The purpose of extracting and cleaning the data is to see if there is a difference/bias between the vine and the non-vine reviews. This would allow SellBy, the company we are consulting for, decided whether paying for the vine service is worth the investment.  

 
## Results 
- According to the data for watches, 47 helpful reviews were from vine and 8326 were from non-vine members. 
- 15 vine reviews were 5-stars compared to the 4321 5-stared reviews for non-vine.
- This means that 31.91% of reviews for vine are 5 stars compared to the 51.90% for non-vine
Please reference figure1 for the details. 
   
## Summary 
In conclusion, there seams to be a little bias with vine members. It looks as if people who are forced to write reviews are more critical than those who are writing based on their experiences. I would recommened seeing the average of the reviews to see if the scores are lower accross the board. This would support this finding.
